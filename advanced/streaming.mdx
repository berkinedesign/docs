## Introduction

Text streaming is a built-in feature in Davinci AI that shows AI responses in real-time as they are generated, providing a more engaging chat experience. This guide explains how text streaming works and what to do if you encounter any issues

## How It Works

Davinci AI’s text streaming functionality:

- Works out of the box on most web servers
- Supports shared hosting environments
- Requires minimal configuration in most cases

<Note>Text streaming is enabled by default and should work immediately after installation. Most users won’t need to make any configuration changes.</Note>

## Server Configuration

While Davinci AI works with default server settings in most cases, some servers might need minor adjustments:

### PHP Settings
If streaming isn’t working, check these settings in your `php.ini` file, try each option separately, it varies from hosting to hosting:
```javascript
output_buffering = On
```
```javascript
output_buffering = 4096
```

<Tip>If you’re using shared hosting and can’t modify php.ini, contact your hosting provider. Many providers can adjust these settings for you if needed.</Tip>


## Troubleshooting Checklist

Use this checklist to diagnose streaming issues:

- Verify PHP configuration settings
- Check web server buffering settings
- Confirm no interfering caching mechanisms
- Test with different browsers
- Clear all application caches
- Monitor server logs for errors
- Verify hosting provider compatibility
