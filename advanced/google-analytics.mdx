## Introduction

Localization is a crucial feature that allows you to make Davinci AI accessible to a global audience. This guide will walk you through the process of translating your Davinci AI, managing language files, and enabling language selection for your users.

## How to Translate

Davinci AI uses `json` files per language, which are stored under `/lang` directory in the root folder of your domain with their respective country codes. Example `en.json` for English language.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Overview">
    Go to **Admin Panel** -> **General Settings** -> **Languages** page to access the **Language Manager** feature.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Language">
    To add a new language, select your language as needed from the **Add New Language** section and click on **Add** button.

  <Step title="Installed Languages">
    All added languages by you will be listed in the **Installed Language** section. <br />
    Use the **checkboxes** to activate or deactivate installed languages, it will save your checkbox changes automatically.
    <Note>User will see only activated languages from the list</Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Default Language">
    To set default language, select your target language as needed from the **Default Language** section and click on **Set** button. <br />
    Note that this list will show only the languages which were enabled in the Installed Languages section, refresh your page if you don't see newly added or enabled languages in the dropdown list.
    <Tip>Only admin can set default languages, hence it will be common for all users as well</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate All JSON Files">
    You can genereate JSON files for all languages listed in the **Installed Languages** section with just one click regardless if some of the languages are enabled there or not via Publish All JSON Files button.
    <Warning>Please note that apart from `en.json` file, all other json language files will be empty, it is up to you to translate them accordingly</Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Synchronize Your JSON files and Main (English) JSON Files">
     This is one of the important features of the Language Manager. It can do 2 things:
     1. As it is not efficient to translate every line individually, most people will simply translate genereated JSON files via various online tools that are avaialble out there. So if you have your language JSON file, simply include it in the `lang` folder in the root directory of your domain, make sure that your language is listed in the Installed Languages list and activated, afterwards click on **Reinstall Language Files** button. This will synchronize all your translations in your updated json files with the database of the script. 
     2. As the script is rapidly growing, the main **lang/en.json** file is regularly updated with almost every update, so make sure to click on **Reinstall Language Files** button if you see in the changelogs that new words were added statement, it will automaically add new strings into all exisitng json files in the lang folder without overwriting existing contents, and the end of the list you will see new strings added for you that you can simply translate manually (as explained in step 6) and save as the added list per update is usually small.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate Individual Strings">
    You can also generate individual language json file and/or translate directly strings by clicking on the target language menu button under **Installed Language** section, and select either **Edit Strings** to translate strings individually or **Generate JSON file** which will generate a JSON file only for this language, which you can use to translate on variou online json translator platforms like [this paid json translator platform](https://hotpot.ai/file-translator?s=translate-json).

  <Step title="Add New Custom Strings via Language Manager">
    <Warning>This option is not available yet, but will come soon as it is already listed on our roadmap for upcoming updates</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final">
    You know have completed the Language Manager configuration.
