  <Step title="Step 2: Configure FFMPEG Codec">
    As most shared hostings providers do not allow you to run **ffmpeg codec**, script comes with one included. Follow these steps to configure it accordingly:
    <Note>FFPEG codec is needed to merge end results into a single audio file, or to add background music into an audio file etc</Note>
    
    1. Make sure you have php `shell_exec` command enabled in your hosting. 
      <Warning>As stated in the [requirements](/requirements) section, it is an important feature that must be enabled in your php settings</Warning>
    2. In the root directory of your domain, go to **vendor** -> **ffmpeg** folder. 
    3. Right click on the **ffmpeg** codec there and select **Change Permission**
